# Good Crypto Resources
A collection of various, very good cryptography resources on a miscellanea of topics.

* [Computing Arbitrary Functions on Encrypted Data](https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf) - The best introduction so far about (fully) homomorphic encryption. You need a basic background in crypto to understand it, but not more than that. Highly advised, fascinating construction.
* [Zero Knowledge Proofs: An illustrated primer](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/) - A very good introduction to zero knowledge proofs (ZN proofs). Quite informal an accessible with just a basic math background, but the general flavour can be understood even without it. Has a more technical part 2.
* [Trapdoors for Lattices: Simpler, Tighter, Faster, Smaller](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/501.pdf) - Parts 4 and 5 explain how lattice trapdoors get created and can be used in pratice. Still lacks some info, but best resource I have found so far.

* [Interpreting complex models with SHAP values](https://medium.com/@gabrieltseng/interpreting-complex-models-with-shap-values-1c187db6ec83) - Vague explanation of how to understand how (simple) machine learning models work.

# Fluid Dynamics
* [Fluid Dynamics - The Navier Stokes equation](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/downloads/pdf/Fluid%20Dynamics:%20The%20Navier-Stokes%20Equations.pdf)
