# Good Crypto Resources
A collection of various, very good cryptography resources on a miscellanea of topics.

* [Computing Arbitrary Functions on Encrypted Data](https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf) - The best introduction so far about (fully) homomorphic encryption. You need a basic background in crypto to understand it, but not more than that. Highly advised, fascinating construction.
* [Zero Knowledge Proofs: An illustrated primer](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/) - A very good introduction to zero knowledge proofs (ZN proofs). Quite informal an accessible with just a basic math background, but the general flavour can be understood even without it. Has a more technical part 2.
